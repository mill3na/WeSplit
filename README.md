# We Split
 Project made with Hacking with Swift classes

## What's We Split?

We Split is a perfect app for the ones that want to split a bill with friends! So, if you want to know how much you and your friends need to pay to get the bills amount, you should use We Split. It also has a tip percentage, if you want to leave some.


## How to use
Please, type the total in the first input. You should erase the "0.00" before.

Then, select the number of people that will pay with you.

After that, select the tip percentage and.. Done! The last label will tell you how much everyone should pay.

## Simulation

This simulation has R$100,00 as total, shared with 3 people with a 15% tip. Each one should give R$38,33.
